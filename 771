First day practice at: https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/description/

class Solution(object):
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
        """
        :type J: str
        :type S: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = 0
        
        list_jew = []
        list_me = []
        
        for i in range(len(J)):
            list_jew.append(J[i])
            
        for j in range(len(S)):
            list_me.append(S[j])
            
#         print list_jew
#         print list_me
            
        for item in list_me:
            if  item in list_jew:
                count += 1
        # print count
        return count
        
        
should have noticed that strings could not be iterated using "item in string blah blah"
